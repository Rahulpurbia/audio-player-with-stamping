### Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.\

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Use a server to run this project in production. Eg. [npm - serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
